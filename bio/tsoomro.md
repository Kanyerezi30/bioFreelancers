## Expertise

With having expertise in drylab / data science / computer science, I also have
hands on experience in molecular __biology__, __microbiology__, and __plant science__.
This is especially important because gives me a superpower of inferring important
biology from mountains of unimportant data.

I am an __all-rounder__ bioinformatician and interested to explore projects in
all realms of science. Having said that, here are some of the areas I have
expertise in:

- Genome assembly
- Genome annotation
- Bioinformatics pipeline and workflow development
- Data analysis and visualization
- Website and Web Application Development


## Services

I am happy to entertain any and all projects including but not limited to software
development, NGS/Illumina/ONT genomic/RNA-Seq/Proteomic data analysis, Visualization
and interpretation.
