# Mikael Huss
Consultant with PhD and Associate Professor degrees in computational biology from the Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden. 
I do machine learning and bioinformatics consulting and have ~20 years' experience in both.

## Expertise
I have worked as a bioinformatics scientist in different capacities, including five years as an academic consulting bioinformatician at [NBIS](http://nbis.se) helping researchers in Sweden with a wide variety of projects, ranging from ecology and antibiotics resistance to gene regulation and the effects of exercise. Very experienced in RNA-seq analysis, on which I co-wrote [a book](https://www.amazon.com/RNA-seq-Data-Analysis-Mathematical-Computational/dp/1466595000) a few years back. Also experienced in e.g. ChIP-seq and related assays, metagenomics, and multi-omics integration. 

## Services
Open for most kinds of bioinformatics projects, from more routine processing to data integration and predictive models using machine learning.
